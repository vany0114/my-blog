# Short bio or description (displayed in the header)
description: I'm a System Engineer from Medellín, Colombia, I love everything related to software development, new technologies, design patterns, and software architecture. I have worked for more than 10 years in this passionate world where I have had the opportunity to work as a developer, technical leader, and software architect. In addition I'm a co-organizer of MDE.NET community, which is a community for .NET developers in Medellín. So I just want to share my experience and of course learn more, because I think teaching is the best way to learn!
