excerpt: Hi everyone, this time I just would like to share with you all an article that I wrote for InfoQ about SignalR Core Alpha, which was the latest and official preview release when I started to write the article (early December of last year), now the latest version is called 1.0.0-preview1-final. The article talks about what changed and why, respect to preview “unofficial” version. There are really awesome changes, I encourage you to read the article and discover the reasons for those changes!
